              CraftGen aims to provide content transformation services suitable
              for a general audience, the output depends significantly on user
              input and the nature of the original content. As such, we cannot
              guarantee the appropriateness of the Assets generated for all
              users.

              terms or Content Policy, your rights to use the Generations may be
              revoked. In such instances, you will receive written notice and a
              reasonable opportunity to correct your violation, unless it was
              clearly illegal or abusive. Be aware that similar or identical
              Generations may be created by other users with their own inputs,
              and your rights are only to the specific Generation you have
              created.
